# Project_1_College_Recruitment_Improvement_Study
RG - CMP 262 - Project 1

Goal: Using Python, perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys.  Provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes. 

## Part 1.  Data Study Questions

  1) What is the primary reason that the Adult Student population (ages 25+) decides to Enroll at CCM?

  2) For those students who identify as a woman and who are enrolled in a computing degree/certificate program at CCM, were there             any specific events/activities coordinated with or by CCM that led them to study said program?

  3) How many students who are enrolled in a computing degree/certificate were influenced positively by someone not employed in CCM         (HS Guidance Counselor, Teacher, Alumni, Employer, current CCM student) and how has that total number and percentage of                 students enrolled in said programs changed from Fall 2020 - Fall 2024?

  4) Is there a correlation between age, race, or gender and those students who opt to begin an associate degree program vs an academic      certificate?
